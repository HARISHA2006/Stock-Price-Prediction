# Stock-Price-Prediction


## AIM

To develop a Recurrent Neural Network model for stock price prediction.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
Predict future stock prices using an RNN model based on historical closing prices from trainset.csv and testset.csv, with data normalized using MinMaxScaler.

## Design Steps

### Step 1:
Import necessary libraries.

### Step 2:
Load and preprocess the data.

### Step 3:
Create input-output sequences.

### Step 4:
Convert data to PyTorch tensors.

### Step 5:
Define the RNN model.

### Step 6:
Train the model using the training data.

### Step 7:
Evaluate the model and plot predictions.
